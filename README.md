# updruino_z80
Use Updruino FPGA boarad (iCE40-UP5K-SG48) as bridge between ZX Spectrum and Raspberry Pi

# warning!
This project uses iCE40-UP5K-SG48 in "CRAM" mode.

By default Updruino ships in "flash mode".

You must re-solder two 0Ohm resistors from Horizontal "Flash" positions to vertical "CRAM" positions.
